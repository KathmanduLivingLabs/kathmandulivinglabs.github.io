The following is a recurring topic of discussion amongst all of us coders here at KLL:

> Are we doing enough to share our learnings with the community?

This blog is an effort in that direction. We feel that just the simple act of practicing writing about our work, will help steer us to this goal.

We will be covering topics such as our choices, our design challenges, user feedback and a lot more.
